I've personalised the project for my own use.

I'm using the HD version of the screen, the existing code did not work for this.
I've therefore updated to use with the latest drivers 

I've removed the weather functions as these were not useful to me.

I have added in a todo module to work with "Grocy"

I've left 3 columns each to be used with any todo or calendar app
